This Instagram bot generates and posts financial news content based on AI-generated headlines, images, and descriptions. The content provided is purely for educational and research purposes and should not be considered financial advice, recommendations, or endorsements. Always consult with a professional financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

The creators of this bot are not responsible for any actions taken based on the information provided by the bot, and users should exercise their judgment and critical data literacy when interpreting the content.

### Project Information:
This project will run until April 14th, 2023, it includes the use of this Instagram bot that automatically generates and posts financial news content 6 times a day, including one educational post around the topic of critical data literacy once per every 4 posts. The bot is built using Python, OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo, Davinci Text, DALL-E APIs, and the Instagram Graph API for posting to Instagram and analyzing user interaction data. This project aims to answer the research question: "How can exposure to AI-generated fake financial news content on Instagram be utilized to gauge and improve critical data literacy among the platform's users?"

### Data Collection:
Data will be collected through user engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, and follows) and qualitative analysis of comments on the AI-generated posts. Additionally, an anonymous survey will be conducted among a random sample of users who engaged with the account to gather their perspectives on the content, its credibility, and critical data literacy.
