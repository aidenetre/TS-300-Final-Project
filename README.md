# TS 300 Final Project
 
This is the repository for my TS 300 Final Project.

The python code utilizes the Instagram Graph API (should I get access to this in time for the project), as well the OPENAI APIs to integrate multiple AI models including text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DALL-E, in the creation of fake financial news content to research and explore the impacts AI can have on the propagation of misinformation.
